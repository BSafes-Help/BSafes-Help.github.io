## A sample page 
![](https://statics.bsafes.com/samplePage.png)

On a page, you could have tags, title, content, photo gallery, file attachments, and comments. In content, you could include text, images, videos, etc. BSafes provides an intutive rich text editor for you to edit content. Every bit of data on a page is encrypted on your device before being sent to cloud with your own key, no others could see your data, not even us at BSafes.

Every page update creates a new page version, you could always see what it is like in previous versions. Version control is very useful for team collaboration.
