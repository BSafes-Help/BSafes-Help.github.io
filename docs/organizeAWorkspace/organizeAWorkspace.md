# Organize a workspace

Each item in a workspace has its own position, you could arrange positons of items to any order. For example, you could move several items(1 page, 2 notebooks, 1 box) before a specific item(a folder).

You could also drop items inside a folder or box. A box could contain any items(pages, notebooks, diaries, folder, and box). However, a folder could only contain pages.
